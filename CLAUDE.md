# Claude Code — neoipcr Instructions

This file documents neoipcr, the R package that imports, reconciles, and validates NeoIPC surveillance data from DHIS2 and calculates epidemiological indicators, returning only what a caller requests. If this repository is checked out as a submodule of the `neoipc-workspace`, the workspace-level `CLAUDE.md` adds the workspace's own guardrails to the ones below.

Path-scoped files hold what is tied to particular files, each applying only where its patterns match: the [R code rules](.claude/rules/r-code.md), the [package internals](.claude/rules/package-internals.md), and the [testing rules](.claude/rules/testing.md).

---

## Guardrails

Untagged bullets are the NeoIPC **universal** guardrails, localized to this repository's stack (examples in R, clauses without a referent here left out); a tagged bullet holds only where it is carried. A universal guardrail changed outside the workspace ends with `<!-- SYNC: propagate to all repos -->` inline at the end of its last line, in this file and in a path-scoped file alike, for the next workspace session to propagate.

- **Never** put personal names or other identifying information in source code, comments, strings, or commit messages, except in copyright statements and file-header attribution lines (`Author:`, `@author`, `Copyright (c)`).
- **Never** read, write, list, glob, search, or otherwise touch anything under `secrets/`, `data/`, or `.env`, at any depth. If the user gives a path there, use it as given without exploring the directory.
- **Never** push directly to `main` or `master` on this repository.
- **Never** make HTTP calls to the DHIS2 API or read JSON files it returned: they hold sensitive surveillance data, and code-level tasks do not need them.
- **Never** put absolute local paths into a checked-in file; use relative paths or generic placeholders. A local checkout path means nothing to anyone else.
- Treat the infection definitions in the Surveillance-Toolkit repository as normative: where code and a definition conflict, **fix the code**, not the definition.
- **Never** introduce non-permissive dependencies (fonts, libraries, templates). All fonts must be SIL OFL or equivalent.
- **Always** write text files as **LF, UTF-8, no BOM**, and pin both in any code that writes a file, since R's text-mode connections write CRLF on Windows. The unit is **the file, not the tool**: one disagreeing writer corrupts a file several tools share, such as the JSON the .NET reporting service binds or a catalogue `msgmerge` rewrites, and a partial rewrite leaves *mixed* line endings, invisible in editors and most diffs. `.gitattributes` normalizes only on commit, so check the **working-tree** column of `git ls-files --eol`, not the diff. A shipped artefact may differ where its call site says so. The R traps are in the [R code rules](.claude/rules/r-code.md).
- **Always** keep each instruction file and its Copilot counterpart in sync: `CLAUDE.md` with `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and each `.claude/rules/<topic>.md` with `.github/instructions/<topic>.instructions.md`; `.github/instructions/code-review.instructions.md` is Copilot's alone. Change one, change the other.
- **Never** repurpose or re-flag a provisioned fixture for a new requirement; **provision a new one**, which is cheap and breaks nothing. A seeded fixture often matters for a property it *lacks*: `AT_TEST_TEST` stays out of `TEST_UNITS` so other tests keep a department that survives test-unit filtering, and flagging it would silently empty them.
- **Always** reach for **differential observation** before testing hypotheses about opaque third-party behaviour (a DHIS2 API response's shape, a tidyverse function's output): **diff** the **complete, unfiltered** state before and after the change, never a capture narrowed to the current hypothesis, which hides the unsuspected candidate.
- **Never** run two integration suites or DHIS2-driving scripts against the same DHIS2 instance at once: they defeat each other's isolation, cross-talk looks like unrelated failures, and a killed run leaves orphaned records. Confirm the earlier run has **finished** (a log ending in a section header has not) in the **process list**, not the shell, since a killed wrapper's children keep running, and launch on a zero count, not via `&&`: `grep -c` succeeds when it finds a run.
- **Always** kill a long run whose **runner** proves broken (a swallowed or over-filtered output stream, a wrapper buffering until exit, a monitor that cannot tell working from hung), fix it, and relaunch, rather than nursing a blind run, and see a new runner print before leaving it.
- **Always** resolve DHIS2 metadata objects **by `code`** (`filter=code:eq:<CODE>`), never by a hard-coded UID: a code says what is driven and greps everywhere, while a UID hides a wrong-object bug and holds only on the instance that generated it. Program stages carry `NEOIPC_STG_<token>` codes; program rule actions and the placeholder validation rule have none and are matched by UID, and a comment says why wherever a UID or a name stands in for a code.
- **Never** adopt a workaround that **reduces what the code verifies or does** (narrowing a test, weakening an assertion, skipping a case, hard-coding what should be derived) without asking: the dangerous one *works*, and only its author knows what stopped being checked. Say what the faithful solution is, what the workaround gives up, and why, and let the user decide, never presenting the limitation as a property of DHIS2 or an R package.
- **Always** bring a stuck investigation to the user once a diff has not settled it or two attempts at the *same* problem have failed: show what you observed, state your hypothesis, and ask. Otherwise a **weaker, stranger solution** wins and gets a confident justification; a degraded assertion, an extra indirection, or "no reliable way exists" is the signal to stop. Pairs with the push-back guardrail.
- **Always** push back when evidence contradicts the user's suggestion or implied assumption: where authoritative sources (the AMA Manual of Style, protocol definitions, language specifications) say otherwise, present the evidence and let the user decide rather than deferring.
- **Always** write English as **Oxford British** and settle spelling, usage, and style by one order of references, each deciding only what the ones before it leave open: the **Oxford Dictionary of English**, the **Concise Medical Dictionary** (Oxford University Press), the **Oxford English Dictionary**, **Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary**, the **AMA Manual of Style**, the **WHO style guide** (2013), **New Hart's Rules**, and the **AP Stylebook**. The dictionaries decide spelling and terminology; the AMA Manual decides capitalization, punctuation (the serial comma among it), abbreviations, units, and **title case, which the titles and headings of reports and other documents use exactly as the Manual specifies it**, while an interface's headings, labels, and notices keep sentence case; the WHO style guide decides what the Manual leaves open, such as the names of countries and International Nonproprietary Names. Where Oxford accepts two spellings, take the one also valid in American English, which makes *-ize* the rule (*organization*, *pseudonymization*). Three families fall outside it: (1) *-yse* does not alternate (*analyse*, *paralyse*); (2) where Oxford has one spelling, the British form stands, medical words included, although Dorland's and the AMA Manual, both American, spell them otherwise (*anaemia*, *oedema*, *paediatric*, *behaviour*, *centre*, *enrolment*, *licence* as a noun); (3) an *-ise* that belongs to the stem stays (*advertise*, *comprise*, *exercise*, *supervise*, *surprise*). Proper names, quoted normative text, third-party identifiers, DHIS2's own terms (*program*, *organisation unit*, *enrollment* as its object), names that identify collected data (*Alpha-hemolytic streptococci*), and *artifact* as the ISO 14289 term keep their own spelling.
- **Always** weigh personal data protection (GDPR) and organizational and reputational concerns in decisions about data shared between partners, published in reports, or exposed through APIs: small cell counts in a shared report can reveal which departments had a rare infectious agent or resistance pattern.
- **Always** treat accessibility and long-term archivability as first-class goals for every document a NeoIPC tool produces for people to read or publish, as far as the toolchain genuinely allows: WCAG (`axe` on HTML), tagged PDF with alt text on every figure and decorative images marked as artifacts, and PDF/A. **Never declare a conformance the output does not have**, since consumers trust the declaration; where a property is out of reach, say so where the setting lives and record what would unblock it. A regression in tagging, alt text, or PDF/A is a defect.
- **Always** treat linguistic, script, and cultural diversity as an **asset and a first-class goal**: the supported languages are a **floor, not a ceiling**, and a tooling limit that falls on non-Latin scripts or non-Western conventions (complex-script shaping, bidirectional text, one region's date or name format) is a **defect to schedule**, not a boundary. **Never declare support the output does not have** ("supported" means *renders correctly*), but ship what works under a label that matches it, name what does not, and record what would unblock it.
- **Never** use deprecated or outdated APIs: before introducing a function from a third-party package or a base library, check that it is current and use its replacement where one exists; when unsure, read the package's `NEWS.md` or release notes rather than assuming.
- **Always** read the upstream source when you need a definitive answer about a third-party system's behaviour (DHIS2 above all, but also R, its packages, and GNU gettext): their documentation, release notes, and changelogs are unreliable, and the source is the authority.
- **Always** parse a structured format with its own parser, not a regex over its text (YAML with `yaml`, JSON with `jsonlite`, R code with `utils::getParseData()`), since a regex silently mis-detects nesting and drops lines it was not aiming at; where no parser exists, say so at the call site. Before concluding that a tool does not diagnose something, **check its log levels**: neoipcr's DHIS2 request trace logs at `DEBUG`, below the default `INFO` threshold, so it shows only once a lower threshold is set, as `neoipcr_log_config("verbose")` sets one.
- **Always** verify an upstream claim the plan depends on now, by reading the source in the planning step; never write "verify at implementation time" or "TBD against upstream" and move on, since every deferred fact invites a wrong implementation later. Pairs with the read-the-upstream-source guardrail above.
- **Always** verify a factual claim in a design note or task file against the source before propagating it: an "X does Y" statement in repository documentation is a hypothesis until the function or module confirms it, and such claims go stale while still looking authoritative. Where one is wrong, fix the document in the same commit.
- **Always** re-read an iteratively edited document end to end before calling it done, for contradictions with later edits, stale paths, drifted summaries, lost deferral markers, and naming drift. When work completes or changes state, **grep the repository** for its earlier names, labels, superseded status phrases, and hard-coded counts and fix each in the same commit; better, **state a volatile fact once** (a test count, a remaining-work list) and reference it.
- **Never** dismiss an inconsistency as "cosmetic" while a rename window is open (pre-alpha, release preparation, a planned breaking change in the same area): once a rename in the same family is proposed, fix it in the same pass.
- **Always** treat test evidence asymmetrically: **a red run proves a failure; a green run proves nothing**, least of all that a safeguard is unnecessary, since it may be what kept the run green. Any change to a wait, guard, retry, or workaround, **added or removed**, carries the burden of proof: **without a proven mechanism it is a hypothesis, not a fix; say so in the comment.** Proof would have come out differently were the explanation wrong: the upstream line that settles it, a probe only that explanation produces, a test that goes red without the change.
- **Never** let a test or its harness **change the system under test**: drive it, and provision fixtures, only as a user or caller would, never forcing a recomputation, stubbing a function to steer control flow, or writing internal state; where it is hard to observe, observe better. **The failure is that it works**: the harness produces the state, the suite turns green, and the defect ships. The one exception is an opt-in diagnostic, off by default, never asserted on, and a pure passthrough.
- **Never** edit a checked-in file through a generated script (a string-replacing one-liner, `sed -i`): use the editor's own edit operation, one change at a time, bulk edits included. A scripted edit hides the change behind the script, and string surgery on structured text drops adjacent code and leaves orphaned declarations. A generated file nobody reviews by hand is the exception.
- **Never** use an unexplained acronym or initialism in comments, doc comments, or documentation: write "Tracker Capture", not "TC", since the reader usually has less context than the writer. Domain terms the repository defines (`NEOIPC_CORE`, DHIS2, SSI, BSI, HAP, and NEC as infection types) are fine; ad-hoc contractions of product or component names are not.
- **Always** number the items, cases, conditions, or alternatives that a text refers back to, and refer to them by number ("requirement 2", "case 3"; their own numbers where they have them, "types 1 and 2"), never as "the first", "the former", or "the latter", which make the reader count back and turn ambiguous once anything in between enumerates something else. This holds for documents, comments, task files, and commit and pull-request messages.
- **Always** call what causes an infection an **infectious agent**, never a *pathogen* or an *organism*, since it may be no pathogen, or no organism (a virus, a prion): in prose, user-facing strings, documentation, comments, and new identifiers, compounds included ("infectious-agent group"). A defined term (*recognized pathogen*, set against *common commensal*), a quotation, and an existing identifier that is a stable contract (`NEOIPC_BSI_PATHOGEN_1`, a column or file name others depend on) keep their wording; such an identifier changes only in a coordinated rename.
- **Never** write filler comments that describe absent behaviour ("not currently used"), restate the obvious, or hedge ("maybe this is needed?"). The default is no comment; keep comments for hidden constraints, subtle invariants, surprising behaviour, and workarounds for specific bugs. A property that makes no sense without a comment is misnamed, misplaced, or should not exist; fix that instead.
- **Always** write doc comments on public API surface (Roxygen `#'` on every exported function), and targeted comments at non-obvious design points, in the change that introduces the code, never in a later sweep. Pairs with the no-filler-comments guardrail above: comments add information, and the warranted ones land in-band.
- **Never** predict the future in code comments: speculative commented-out code, a forward-looking `# TODO: when X happens, do Y`, or any text about undecided changes belongs in the project's task tracking. A comment describes *what is*, not *what might be*.
- **Always** write the *outcome* of a decision into a checked-in file, not the path to it: state **what is true now and why**, in the present tense. Superseded values (`# this was 10 mm`), who changed what when, and the loop that produced the answer (a correction taken, a review acted on) belong to git and the commit message. **A failure is sometimes what the next reader needs** (an attractive alternative that fails, a measurement that inverted the expectation), but which ones stay is **the maintainer's call**: leave them out and **ask**, and word a kept one as a standing property ("X is not used, because Y"). Pairs with the no-future-prediction guardrail.
- **Never** reference internal project-tracking identifiers in checked-in source or comments (milestone or phase labels such as `M3`, plan-decision numbers, task-file or plan names, sprints): they mean nothing without the plan and go stale with it. Say what the code does in its own terms, keep the linkage in task tracking and the commit message, and describe provisional code intrinsically ("currently not handled"). Pairs with the no-future-prediction guardrail.
- **Never** leave placeholder stubs (`stop("not implemented")`) in source as scaffolding: code that exists only to fail until the real implementation "comes later" is dead code. Delete it; the planned work belongs in task tracking.
- **Always** mark a backwards-compatibility path with the **right one of two** tokens: `NEOIPC-COMPAT(<scope>)`, *remove once its condition holds*, or `NEOIPC-PERMANENT(<scope>)`, **never remove**; swapped, they schedule an outage or leave cruft nobody dares delete. The test is **whether anyone can establish the condition**: a deployment can be queried, so an older instance's fallback is `NEOIPC-COMPAT` with a checkable condition, never a date; a persisted artefact or an identifier in collected data outlives every deployment, so reading it is `NEOIPC-PERMANENT`, saying what breaks without it. Reason once, cross-reference (`NEOIPC-<TOKEN>(<scope>): see …`), mark the test, keep one concern per scope. Compatibility is owed to **values from outside** (DHIS2 metadata, catalogue strings, serialized datasets), never to callers of our own pre-alpha interfaces.
- **Never** add a `Co-Authored-By` trailer crediting an **AI, an IDE, or any other tool**: a tool is not a co-author, and the user does not want AI attribution. **Human co-authors are the opposite case**: their trailers are attribution, sometimes a licence condition, and survive every squash or rewritten message, including trailers a platform adds on a contributor's behalf.
- **NEVER merge a pull request without the user's explicit approval of that specific merge, and never before every review on it has arrived and been addressed.** Say what you propose to merge and wait for a plain "yes, merge it" naming that request. **These are not approval:** "move on", "go ahead", "now", or any instruction to continue the surrounding work; your own belief that the change is finished, tested, or urgent; approval of an *earlier* merge; and an **administrator override**, which bypasses one gate and says nothing about whether the change should land. **Approval is anchored to the commit it was given for**: any push, however small or review-driven, invalidates it, so re-confirm, naming the new head. **Wait for every review, the automated ones included, and for every reviewer, not the first to answer**, checking immediately before merging. **Ask in the working session, never on the forge**: a review from the maintainer's account may be another agent, which can neither grant approval nor be argued with about one. Merging past a running review cannot be undone short of a history rewrite, and the review may hold the finding that keeps a volunteer's name and e-mail address out of a public repository. When in doubt, ask.
- **Never** create a merge commit; **always** squash-merge, so a pull request lands as exactly **one** commit and history stays linear, as the repository's settings enforce (merge commits and rebase merging disabled). **Compose the squash message; never accept the pre-filled one**, which strings the branch's work-in-progress messages together: say what the change delivers and why, at the thematic level. A single-commit branch may keep its message, but read it: the squash is the only point where a tool's co-author trailer can be removed. **These rules interlock**: the message enumerates no changes, comments on no review process, gains no AI or tool trailer, and keeps every **human** co-author trailer, and a branch under review falls to the force-push rule.
- **Never** call out the review process in commit, pull-request, or squash messages ("review-driven deltas", "round 7 fixed X", "fixes from Copilot feedback"); that belongs in the review threads, where credit for a finding is given. A message that cannot name the review describes the defect, not its discovery, and never implies its author found what a reviewer did.
- **Never** enumerate every individual change in a commit, pull-request, or squash message: describe what it delivers at the *thematic* level (features, capabilities, design decisions), naming a file or function only where it anchors a point.
- **Never** use a bare `#N` for an issue or work item in a **different repository or tracker**: GitHub and GitLab link it to item N of the repository you write in, notifying an unrelated item. Write "neoipc-dhis2 work item N" or the full URL, keep a bare `#N` for the same repository, and check every `#N` before posting.
- **Never** change the user's global git config (`git config --global`, `~/.gitconfig`) to get past a transient failure: retry it, since a global tweak (`core.compression=0`, an `http.postBuffer` bump) persists across every repository. Tune one repository with `git config --local` or a one-shot `-c key=value`, and propose a genuine global change with its reason and cost.
- **Never** force-push to a branch that has an open pull request under review: rewriting pushed history discards reviewers' work in progress, detaches their comments from lines and commits, and hides what changed since they last looked. Push follow-up commits instead, which the squash merge collapses. Force-pushing is acceptable only on a private branch nobody has been asked to review.
- **Never** put long-lived guidance in per-machine local memory (Claude Code's `~/.claude/.../memory/`), which does not follow the user across machines: coding rules, communication preferences, domain conventions, and recurring corrections go into the instruction files (`CLAUDE.md`, or the rules file for their topic, with their Copilot counterparts). Local memory is for ephemeral session context.
- **Never** cite an agent tool's **per-machine session artefact** from a checked-in file as a source (a plan under `~/.claude/plans/`, a transcript or tool result under `~/.claude/projects/`, local memory): it exists on one machine only. **Inline the durable content** instead; describing such a path where the path itself is the subject is fine. Pairs with the absolute-path and local-memory guardrails.

## Commands

From the package root:

- `devtools::document()`: regenerate `NAMESPACE` and `man/` from the Roxygen blocks.
- `devtools::test()`, or `devtools::test_active_file("tests/testthat/test-<name>.R")` for one file: run the tests.
- `devtools::check()`: run `R CMD check`.
- `Rscript scripts/coverage.R`: write the `covr` report to `coverage.html` and open it, unless the argument is `quiet`.
- `Rscript tools/update_po.R`: regenerate `po/R-neoipcr.pot`, merge it into each `po/R-<lang>.po`, and compile the `.mo` files; it needs GNU gettext's `msgmerge` and `msgfmt` reachable from R.

---

## R/ File Structure

Every new function and file lands in its place, or `R/` decays silently; if in doubt, ask the user.

### File Naming

- **`import-*.R`**: user-facing import orchestrators, one per data source (`import-dhis2.R`); the `import-standalone-*.R` files are rlang's, vendored and never edited by hand.
- **`dhis2-*.R`**: DHIS2-specific internals (connection, metadata, readers).
- **`validation-rules-*.R`**: one file per validation domain; the registry and `validate()` stay in `validation.R`, the exception list in `validation-exceptions.R`.
- **`data-protection.R`**: the data-protection assertions alone.
- **`tests/testthat/test-<name>.R`**: the tests of `R/<name>.R`.

### Function Placement

- A new **table builder** goes in `calc-tables.R`, a **rate computer** in `calc-rates.R`, and a **denominator** in `calc-denominators.R`, never in another of these layers of the epidemiological analysis pipeline.
- A new **validation rule** goes in the `validation-rules-*.R` file of its domain, or in a new `validation-rules-<domain>.R` where none fits.
- A new **metadata reader** goes in `dhis2-metadata-options.R` (option sets), `dhis2-metadata-reference.R` (reference data), or `dhis2-metadata-orgunits.R` (organisation units); `dhis2-metadata.R` stays a thin orchestrator.
